# Docker Model Runner

Docker Model Runner (DMR) makes it easy to manage, run, and deploy AI models using Docker. Designed for developers, Docker Model Runner streamlines the process of pulling, running, and serving large language models (LLMs) and other AI models directly from Docker Hub or any OCI-compliant registry.

## Overview

This package supports the Docker Model Runner in Docker Desktop and Docker Engine.

### Installation

For macOS and Windows, install Docker Desktop:

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/

For Linux, install Docker Engine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo bash
```

Docker Model Runner is included in the above tools.

For more details refer to:

https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/get-started/

### Prerequisites

Before building from source, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go 1.24+** - Required for building both model-runner and model-cli
- **Git** - For cloning repositories
- **Make** - For using the provided Makefiles
- **Docker** (optional) - For building and running containerized versions
- **CGO dependencies** - Required for model-runner's GPU support:
  - On macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - On Linux: gcc/g++ and development headers
  - On Windows: MinGW-w64 or Visual Studio Build Tools

### Building the Complete Stack

#### Step 1: Clone and Build model-runner (Server/Daemon)

```bash
# Clone the model-runner repository
git clone https://github.com/docker/model-runner.git
cd model-runner

# Build the model-runner binary
make build

# Or build with specific backend arguments
make run LLAMA_ARGS="--verbose --jinja -ngl 999 --ctx-size 2048"

# Run tests to verify the build
make test
```

The `model-runner` binary will be created in the current directory. This is the backend server that manages models.

#### Step 2: Build model-cli (Client)

```bash
# From the root directory, navigate to the model-cli directory
cd cmd/cli

# Build the CLI binary
make build

# The binary will be named 'model-cli'
# Optionally, install it as a Docker CLI plugin
make install  # This will link it to ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-model
```

### Testing the Complete Stack End-to-End

> **Note:** We use port 13434 in these examples to avoid conflicts with Docker Desktop's built-in Model Runner, which typically runs on port 12434.

#### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended for Contributors)

1. **Start model-runner in one terminal:**
```bash
cd model-runner
MODEL_RUNNER_PORT=13434 ./model-runner
# The server will start on port 13434
```

2. **Use model-cli in another terminal:**
```bash
cd cmd/cli
# List available models (connecting to port 13434)
MODEL_RUNNER_HOST=http://localhost:13434 ./model-cli list

# Pull and run a model
MODEL_RUNNER_HOST=http://localhost:13434 ./model-cli run ai/smollm2 "Hello, how are you?" 
```

#### Option 2: Using Docker

1. **Build and run model-runner in Docker:**
```bash
cd model-runner
make docker-build
make docker-run PORT=13434 MODELS_PATH=/path/to/models
```

2. **Connect with model-cli:**
```bash
cd cmd/cli
MODEL_RUNNER_HOST=http://localhost:13434 ./model-cli list
```

## Using the Makefile

This project includes a Makefile to simplify common development tasks. It requires Docker Desktop >= 4.41.0 
The Makefile provides the following targets:

- `build` - Build the Go application
- `run` - Run the application locally
- `clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `test` - Run tests
- `docker-build` - Build the Docker image
- `docker-run` - Run the application in a Docker container with TCP port access and mounted model storage
- `help` - Show available targets

### Running in Docker

The application can be run in Docker with the following features enabled by default:
- TCP port access (default port 8080)
- Persistent model storage in a local `models` directory

```sh
# Run with default settings
make docker-run

# Customize port and model storage location
make docker-run PORT=3000 MODELS_PATH=/path/to/your/models
```

This will:
- Create a `models` directory in your current working directory (or use the specified path)
- Mount this directory into the container
- Start the service on port 8080 (or the specified port)
- All models downloaded will be stored in the host's `models` directory and will persist between container runs

### llama.cpp integration

The Docker image includes the llama.cpp server binary from the `docker/docker-model-backend-llamacpp` image. You can specify the version of the image to use by setting the `LLAMA_SERVER_VERSION` variable. Additionally, you can configure the target OS, architecture, and acceleration type:

```sh
# Build with a specific llama.cpp server version
make docker-build LLAMA_SERVER_VERSION=v0.0.4

# Specify all parameters
make docker-build LLAMA_SERVER_VERSION=v0.0.4 LLAMA_SERVER_VARIANT=cpu
```

Default values:
- `LLAMA_SERVER_VERSION`: latest
- `LLAMA_SERVER_VARIANT`: cpu

The binary path in the image follows this pattern: `/com.docker.llama-server.native.linux.${LLAMA_SERVER_VARIANT}.${TARGETARCH}`

## API Examples

The Model Runner exposes a REST API that can be accessed via TCP port. You can interact with it using curl commands.

### Using the API

When running with `docker-run`, you can use regular HTTP requests:

```sh
# List all available models
curl http://localhost:8080/models

# Create a new model
curl http://localhost:8080/models/create -X POST -d '{"from": "ai/smollm2"}'

# Get information about a specific model
curl http://localhost:8080/models/ai/smollm2

# Chat with a model
curl http://localhost:8080/engines/llama.cpp/v1/chat/completions -X POST -d '{
  "model": "ai/smollm2",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
  ]
}'

# Delete a model
curl http://localhost:8080/models/ai/smollm2 -X DELETE

# Get metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

The response will contain the model's reply:

```json
{
  "id": "chat-12345",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1682456789,
  "model": "ai/smollm2",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I assist you today?"
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 24,
    "completion_tokens": 16,
    "total_tokens": 40
  }
}
```

## NVIDIA NIM Support

Docker Model Runner supports running NVIDIA NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) containers directly. This provides a simplified workflow for deploying NVIDIA's optimized inference containers.

### Prerequisites

- Docker with NVIDIA GPU support (nvidia-docker2 or Docker with NVIDIA Container Runtime)
- NGC API Key (optional, but required for some NIM models)
- Docker login to nvcr.io registry

### Quick Start

1. **Login to NVIDIA Container Registry:**

```bash
docker login nvcr.io
Username: $oauthtoken
Password: <PASTE_API_KEY_HERE>
```

2. **Set NGC API Key (if required by the model):**

```bash
export NGC_API_KEY=<PASTE_API_KEY_HERE>
```

3. **Run a NIM model:**

```bash
docker model run nvcr.io/nim/google/gemma-3-1b-it:latest
```

That's it! The Docker Model Runner will:
- Automatically detect that this is a NIM image
- Pull the NIM container image
- Configure it with proper GPU support, shared memory (16GB), and NGC credentials
- Start the container and wait for it to be ready
- Provide an interactive chat interface

### Features

- **Automatic GPU Detection**: Automatically configures NVIDIA GPU support if available
- **Persistent Caching**: Models are cached in `~/.cache/nim` (or `$LOCAL_NIM_CACHE` if set)
- **Interactive Chat**: Supports both single prompt and interactive chat modes
- **Container Reuse**: Existing NIM containers are reused across runs

### Example Usage

**Single prompt:**
```bash
docker model run nvcr.io/nim/google/gemma-3-1b-it:latest "Explain quantum computing"
```

**Interactive chat:**
```bash
docker model run nvcr.io/nim/google/gemma-3-1b-it:latest
> Tell me a joke
...
> /bye
```

### Configuration

- **NGC_API_KEY**: Set this environment variable to authenticate with NVIDIA's services
- **LOCAL_NIM_CACHE**: Override the default cache location (default: `~/.cache/nim`)

### Technical Details

NIM containers:
- Run on port 8000 (localhost only)
- Use 16GB shared memory by default
- Mount `~/.cache/nim` for model caching
- Support NVIDIA GPU acceleration when available

## Metrics

The Model Runner exposes [the metrics endpoint](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/tools/server#get-metrics-prometheus-compatible-metrics-exporter) of llama.cpp server at the `/metrics` endpoint. This allows you to monitor model performance, request statistics, and resource usage.

### Accessing Metrics

```sh
# Get metrics in Prometheus format
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

### Configuration

- **Enable metrics (default)**: Metrics are enabled by default
- **Disable metrics**: Set `DISABLE_METRICS=1` environment variable
- **Monitoring integration**: Add the endpoint to your Prometheus configuration

Check [METRICS.md](./METRICS.md) for more details.
